# BirdDetection-FeaturesExtraction

This Master Thesis takes place in the RevealFlight project (https://sites.uclouvain.be/RevealFlight/) from UCLouvain which aims to improve the understanding of bird flocks flight by unifying different scientific fields (physics, bio-engineering disciplines, and problematic of control and self-organization).

The main objective of this thesis is to develop a computer vision-based toolbox for processing low quality bird videos to perform bird detection and features extraction. In more detail, the toolbox has to detect multiple birds in the images and identify the stroke phase even with overlap with other birds, to track the wing tips of each bird over multiple frames, detect the bird's skeleton and extract features of the bird and his movement (speed, span, phase, phase differences between birds, ...).

The thesis will be decompose in three main blocks: data processing, detection/model training, features extraction. These are described below.

My name is Adrien Delhez, a second-year master's student in applied mathematics from UCLouvain. This project is my Master thesis and I'm going to work on it during this year 2021.
